# ðŸ’³ Payment System Setup Guide

## Current Status: ENABLED âœ…

The payment system is now **enabled** with real Paystack integration using KES currency. The system has been updated with the working UI and payment configuration from the working HTML file.

## ðŸš€ Payment System Configuration

### Step 1: Payment System is Already Enabled âœ…

The payment system has been automatically enabled. The payment routes file has been updated and is ready to use.

### Step 2: Add Paystack Credentials
```bash
# Add these to your .env file
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key_here
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_your_public_key_here
```

**How to get Paystack keys:**
1. Go to [Paystack Dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com)
2. Sign up/Login to your account
3. Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
4. Copy your live keys (the system is configured for production)

**Note:** The frontend is already configured with the live Paystack key: `pk_live_5f7de652daf3ea53dc685902c5f28f0a2063bc33`

### Step 3: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Apply the subscription system database schema
python scripts/apply_migrations.py
```

### Step 4: Restart the Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
python app.py
```

## âœ… What You'll Get

Once enabled, you'll have:

### **Subscription Plans (KES):**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If you get syntax errors:
1. Check for missing `}` or `)` in the payment routes file
2. Make sure all functions are properly closed
3. Use a code editor with syntax highlighting

### If payment service doesn't initialize:
1. Check that Paystack keys are in `.env` file
2. Verify the keys are correct (test vs live)
3. Check the console for error messages

### If database migration fails:
1. Make sure Supabase credentials are correct
2. Check that you have write permissions
3. Run the migration script with proper error handling
